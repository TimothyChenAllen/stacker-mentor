# stacker-mentor - Full Stack Lessons I learned from a Gemini Gem

See [GEM.md] for the prompt I used. This prompt could be used in any LLM.

## Lesson 1. Get Started with React + Vite + TypeScript

**Objective**. Learn how to initialize a React.js + Vite + TypeScript app

I asked the Gem to show me how to get started with a React + Vite + TypeScript app. They
gave me this code, which creates a sample app in an existing directory:

```bash
cd stacker-mentor
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

**Success**. I knew it worked when I had a working app running at http://localhost:5173/
